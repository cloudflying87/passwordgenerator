Project Random Password generator

The goal of this project was to create a random password generator in JavaScript. I was to get the length from the user and 4 different criteria. The criteria were uppercase, lowercase, special characters, and numbers. After the user decided on those criteria, I generated a random password using their input. 

I currently add each set of characters to the string for the random generation of the password. The problem with this approach is that I have no way of guaranteeing that something will be taken from each category. This would be a place for further development.
